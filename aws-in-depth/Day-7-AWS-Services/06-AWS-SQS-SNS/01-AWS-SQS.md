# AWS SQS (Amazon Simple Queue Service)

AWS SQS (Amazon Simple Queue Service) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables users to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It helps manage and operate message-oriented middleware, allowing developers to focus on their core work.

Amazon SQS handles the message delivery reliably at any scale without requiring other services to be always available. It supports sending, storing, and receiving messages between software components and can be accessed through various tools such as the Amazon Console, command line interface, and SDKs.

## Types of Queues in Amazon SQS

### Standard Queue

- **Description**: Standard queues offer at least once delivery and maximum throughput. They support a high volume of transactions per second per API action.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Delivery**: Guarantees at least one delivery of each message, but may deliver multiple copies of a message.
  - **Order**: Messages may be delivered in a different order than they were sent.
  - **Throughput**: Supports a high number of transactions per second.

### FIFO Queue

- **Description**: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues guarantee that messages are processed exactly once and in the exact order they are sent.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Order**: Messages are strictly preserved in the order they are sent and received.
  - **Throughput**: Can handle up to 300 messages per second, including 300 send, receive, and delete operations per second.
  - **Duplication**: Messages are not duplicated and are retained until explicitly deleted by the customer.

## Key Features

- **Reliable Message Delivery**: Ensures that messages are delivered without loss.
- **Scalability**: Can handle any volume of messages and scale as needed.
- **Flexible Access**: Integrates with various tools including the Amazon Console, CLI, and SDKs.

## Architecture

AWS SQS architecture includes several key components that work together to handle message queuing:

### 1. Queues
   - **Description:** A queue is a temporary storage location for messages that are waiting to be processed. AWS SQS supports two types of queues: Standard Queues and FIFO Queues.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Standard Queue:** Offers high throughput, at-least-once delivery, and best-effort ordering.
     - **FIFO Queue:** Ensures exactly-once processing and preserves the order of messages.
   - **Use Case:** A web application uses a standard queue to handle user registration requests, allowing the backend to process each request asynchronously.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges based on the number of requests and the amount of data transferred. FIFO queues incur additional charges compared to standard queues due to the ordering and deduplication features.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a Standard Queue
     aws sqs create-queue --queue-name my-standard-queue

     # Create a FIFO Queue
     aws sqs create-queue --queue-name my-fifo-queue.fifo --attributes FifoQueue=true,ContentBasedDeduplication=true
     ```

### 2. Messages
   - **Description:** Messages are the data or information that are sent to or received from a queue. Each message can be up to 256 KB in size.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Message Body:** Contains the actual data to be transmitted.
     - **Attributes:** Metadata associated with the message, such as delay or message group ID for FIFO queues.
   - **Use Case:** An e-commerce application sends a message to a queue containing order details that need to be processed by a payment service.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges based on the number of messages sent, received, or deleted. The size of messages also impacts the cost.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Send a Message
     aws sqs send-message --queue-url <QueueURL> --message-body "Order details"

     # Receive a Message
     aws sqs receive-message --queue-url <QueueURL>

     # Delete a Message
     aws sqs delete-message --queue-url <QueueURL> --receipt-handle <ReceiptHandle>
     ```

### 3. Queues Attributes
   - **Description:** Queue attributes are configuration settings for queues, such as visibility timeout, message retention period, and maximum message size.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Visibility Timeout:** The amount of time a message is invisible to other consumers after being read.
     - **Retention Period:** The length of time that messages are retained in the queue.
   - **Use Case:** Adjusting the visibility timeout of a queue to ensure that messages are not processed by multiple consumers simultaneously.
   - **Billing Details:** Some attributes, like long polling, may incur additional costs. Adjustments to retention periods or message sizes can impact overall costs.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Set Queue Attributes
     aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url <QueueURL> --attributes VisibilityTimeout=60

     # Get Queue Attributes
     aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url <QueueURL> --attribute-names All
     ```

### 4. Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs)
   - **Description:** DLQs are used to handle messages that could not be processed successfully after a specified number of attempts.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Main Queue:** The original queue where messages are sent.
     - **DLQ:** A separate queue where failed messages are redirected.
   - **Use Case:** Messages that fail processing multiple times are moved to a DLQ for further investigation or manual handling.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges for DLQs are similar to regular queues, based on the number of requests and data transferred.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a DLQ
     aws sqs create-queue --queue-name my-dlq

     # Configure DLQ for Main Queue
     aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url <MainQueueURL> --attributes RedrivePolicy='{"deadLetterTargetArn":"<DLQArn>","maxReceiveCount":"5"}'
     ```

### 5. Long Polling
   - **Description:** Long polling reduces the number of empty responses by allowing the receive message call to wait for a specified duration for a message to become available.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Receive Message Call:** Uses a wait time to avoid returning empty responses.
   - **Use Case:** Reducing the number of API requests and improving efficiency in message retrieval by waiting for messages to arrive.
   - **Billing Details:** Costs are included in the standard pricing for requests. Long polling may reduce the total number of requests, potentially lowering overall costs.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Receive a message with long polling
     aws sqs receive-message --queue-url <QueueURL> --wait-time-seconds 20
     ```

### 6. Message Visibility Timeout
   - **Description:** The visibility timeout is the duration during which a message is hidden from other consumers after being read by a consumer.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Visibility Timeout:** Ensures that a message is not processed multiple times if a consumer fails to process it within the timeout period.
   - **Use Case:** Adjusting the timeout to ensure that messages are only reprocessed if not successfully handled within the allotted time.
   - **Billing Details:** No additional cost specifically for visibility timeout settings, but it impacts the overall efficiency and processing of messages.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Change Visibility Timeout for a Message
     aws sqs change-message-visibility --queue-url <QueueURL> --receipt-handle <ReceiptHandle> --visibility-timeout 120
     ```

### 7. Access Control
   - **Description:** AWS SQS provides fine-grained access control using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and SQS policies.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **IAM Policies:** Define permissions for users and roles.
     - **SQS Policies:** Define permissions specific to the queue.
   - **Use Case:** Granting specific users or services permission to send or receive messages from a queue based on their roles.
   - **Billing Details:** Access control is included in standard pricing. Complexity in policy management can affect administrative costs.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Attach IAM Policy to User
     aws iam put-user-policy --user-name <UserName> --policy-name <PolicyName> --policy-document file://policy.json

     # Add Queue Policy
     aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url <QueueURL> --attributes Policy=file://policy.json
     ```

## Billing Details

### Cost Factors

1. **Queue Requests:** Charges based on the number of requests (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, etc.).
2. **Data Transfer:** Costs associated with data transferred in and out of SQS queues.
3. **Message Retention:** Charges based on the amount of data stored in queues and the retention period.
4. **Long Polling:** Long polling incurs no additional costs but can impact overall request efficiency.
5. **DLQs:** Dead-Letter Queues incur charges similar to standard queues.

### Pricing Tiers

- **Standard Queues:** Typically less expensive and suitable for most use cases.
- **FIFO Queues:** Higher costs due to additional features like message ordering and deduplication.

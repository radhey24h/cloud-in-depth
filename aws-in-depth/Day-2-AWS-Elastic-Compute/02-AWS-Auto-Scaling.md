# AWS Auto Scaling
AWS Auto Scaling is a service that helps us to maintain application availability and allows us to automatically add or remove resources according to the current demand. It ensures that we have the right number of Amazon EC2 instances running to handle the load of our application.

The Autoscaling feature is used to scale up and down automatically when it is required.

The application available at AWS requires space and load and the Auto Scaling helps us by providing surety that there is a sufficient number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle that load.

We can set a limit on EC2 instances such that the number doesnâ€™t go below this.

The maximum numbers of EC2 instances can be set to be on a safer side.

AWS Autoscaling ensures that your group has a sufficient amount of servers.

Auto-scaling automatically modifies the EC2 instance as per your demand changes.

One can access Auto Scaling by signing into the AWS Management Console.

It also helps us with some functions such as retrying requests, and handling error responses, making it is easier for the applicant to get started.

## Key Features of AWS Auto Scaling

- **Automatic Resource Management**: AWS Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances or other resources based on predefined policies, schedules, or health checks.
- **Cost Efficiency**: By automatically scaling resources in or out based on demand, AWS Auto Scaling helps optimize costs, ensuring you only pay for what you need.
- **Improved Application Availability**: It maintains application availability by ensuring the right amount of resources is running to handle current traffic demands.
- **Scalable Across AWS Services**: Besides EC2, AWS Auto Scaling supports other AWS services like Amazon ECS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon RDS.

## How AWS Auto Scaling Works

AWS Auto Scaling works by monitoring your applications and automatically adjusting capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. It uses scaling policies and scheduled actions to determine when to scale your resources.

## Key Concepts

- **Scaling Plan**: A set of instructions that tells Auto Scaling how to adjust resources in response to changes in demand.
- **Scaling Policies**: Rules that define how and when to scale resources. These can be based on metrics like CPU utilization, request count, or custom CloudWatch metrics.
- **Scheduled Actions**: Actions that scale resources based on a predefined schedule.
- **Target Tracking**: A scaling policy that adjusts resources to maintain a specified target utilization, such as keeping CPU utilization at 50%.

## AWS Auto Scaling vs Manual Scaling

- **AWS Auto Scaling** automatically manages resource scaling based on demand, reducing the need for manual intervention and helping to prevent over-provisioning.
- **Manual Scaling** requires constant monitoring and manual adjustment of resources, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs.

### Key Differences

- **Automation**: Auto Scaling automates the scaling process, while manual scaling requires user intervention.
- **Efficiency**: Auto Scaling optimizes resource usage and costs, while manual scaling can result in over-provisioning or under-provisioning.
- **Management**: Auto Scaling provides a hands-off approach to managing resources, while manual scaling requires active management.

## Important Terms

- **Launch Configuration/Template**: Defines the type of instance to launch, the AMI, instance type, security groups, and key pairs.
- **Auto Scaling Group**: A collection of EC2 instances treated as a logical group for scaling and management purposes.
- **Desired Capacity**: The ideal number of instances that the auto-scaling group should have at any time.
- **Minimum and Maximum Capacity**: Defines the lower and upper bounds for the number of instances in the auto-scaling group.

## Benefits of AWS Auto Scaling

1. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts resources in response to demand changes.
2. **Predictive Scaling**: Uses machine learning to predict future traffic and adjust resources accordingly.
3. **Cross-Resource Scaling**: Can scale multiple resources across different AWS services simultaneously.

## Limitations of AWS Auto Scaling

- **Latency**: There might be a delay between detecting a change in demand and launching or terminating instances.
- **Complexity**: Requires proper configuration of scaling policies and metrics to function optimally.

## Use Cases for AWS Auto Scaling

1. **Web Applications**: Maintain performance during peak traffic periods and reduce costs during off-peak times.
2. **Batch Processing**: Scale compute resources based on the volume of jobs to be processed.
3. **Data Processing**: Automatically adjust resources for data analytics or ETL workloads.

# AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)

AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SNS supports various types of communication, including messages sent to endpoints like email, SMS, or application endpoints.

## AWS SNS Architecture

AWS SNS architecture includes several key components that work together to provide messaging and notification services:

### 1. Topics
   - **Description:** Topics are communication channels used by publishers to send messages. Subscribers can then receive these messages from topics they are subscribed to.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name):** A unique identifier for the topic used in API requests.
     - **Publishers:** Applications or services that send messages to the topic.
     - **Subscribers:** Endpoints or services that receive messages from the topic.
   - **Use Case:** An e-commerce application uses SNS topics to notify users about order updates. Topics are used to publish messages about order statuses, and subscribers receive these updates via email or SMS.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of messages published, the number of notifications delivered, and the number of subscriptions.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a new SNS topic
     aws sns create-topic --name my-topic

     # List all SNS topics
     aws sns list-topics

     # Delete an SNS topic
     aws sns delete-topic --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic
     ```

### 2. Subscriptions
   - **Description:** Subscriptions define how messages sent to a topic are delivered to endpoints. Endpoints can be email, SMS, HTTP/S, Lambda functions, SQS queues, or application endpoints.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Subscription ARN:** A unique identifier for each subscription.
     - **Endpoint:** The target where the messages are sent (e.g., email address, phone number).
   - **Use Case:** A retail company wants to send SMS notifications to customers about promotions. They create a subscription that directs messages from the SNS topic to customer phone numbers.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of subscriptions and the type of delivery (e.g., SMS messages incur additional costs).
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Subscribe an email endpoint to a topic
     aws sns subscribe --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic --protocol email --notification-endpoint user@example.com

     # Subscribe an SMS endpoint to a topic
     aws sns subscribe --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic --protocol sms --notification-endpoint +1234567890

     # List all subscriptions
     aws sns list-subscriptions

     # Unsubscribe from a topic
     aws sns unsubscribe --subscription-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic:abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678
     ```

### 3. Messages
   - **Description:** Messages are the payloads sent to SNS topics. They can be text-based or in JSON format and can include attributes like message structure and message group ID.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Message Body:** The content of the message being sent.
     - **Message Attributes:** Additional metadata for filtering or processing messages.
   - **Use Case:** A company sends promotional messages to subscribers via an SNS topic. Each message includes information about discounts and offers.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of messages published to topics and the type of message delivery.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Publish a message to a topic
     aws sns publish --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic --message "Your order has been shipped!"

     # Publish a message with attributes
     aws sns publish --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic --message "Your order has been shipped!" --message-attributes '{"orderID": {"DataType": "String", "StringValue": "12345"}}'
     ```

### 4. Topics Policies
   - **Description:** Topic policies control access to SNS topics. They define who can publish to or subscribe to a topic.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Policy Document:** JSON document specifying permissions for topics.
   - **Use Case:** An organization restricts access to an SNS topic so that only specific applications or users can publish messages.
   - **Billing Details:** No additional cost for topic policies, but misconfigured policies may lead to additional troubleshooting costs.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Set a topic policy
     aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic --attribute-name Policy --attribute-value '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"AWS":"*"},"Action":"SNS:Publish","Resource":"arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic"}]}'
     ```

### 5. Delivery Policies
   - **Description:** Delivery policies define how messages are delivered to endpoints and handle retry behavior.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Policy Document:** JSON document specifying retry and backoff settings.
   - **Use Case:** Configuring delivery policies to retry failed message deliveries to an HTTP endpoint with an exponential backoff strategy.
   - **Billing Details:** Costs are associated with retries and the number of message deliveries attempted.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Set a delivery policy
     aws sns set-subscription-attributes --subscription-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic:abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678 --attribute-name DeliveryPolicy --attribute-value '{"http": {"defaultHealthyRetryPolicy": {"numRetries": 5, "numRetriesOnTimeout": 3}}}'
     ```

### 6. Message Filtering
   - **Description:** Message filtering allows you to filter messages based on message attributes and subscription filter policies.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Filter Policy:** JSON document defining which messages a subscription should receive based on message attributes.
   - **Use Case:** Filtering messages to only deliver promotions to subscribers interested in specific product categories.
   - **Billing Details:** No additional cost for message filtering, but incorrect filters may result in missed notifications.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Set a subscription filter policy
     aws sns set-subscription-attributes --subscription-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic:abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678 --attribute-name FilterPolicy --attribute-value '{"category": ["electronics"]}'
     ```

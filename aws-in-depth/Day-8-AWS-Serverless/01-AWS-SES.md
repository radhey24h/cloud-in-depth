## AWS SES Architecture

AWS SES architecture includes several key components that facilitate the sending, receiving, and management of emails:

   - **Architecture:** 
     - **SMTP Interface:** A traditional SMTP interface for sending emails.
     - **SES API:** A RESTful API for sending emails programmatically.
   - **Use Case:** An e-commerce platform sends order confirmation and promotional emails to customers.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of emails sent, the data transfer size, and additional features like dedicated IP addresses.
   - **Commands and Code:**
     ```bash
     # Send an email using AWS CLI
     aws ses send-email --from sender@example.com --destination "ToAddresses=recipient@example.com" --message "Subject={Data=Test},Body={Text={Data=Hello}}" --region us-west-2
     ```

     ```python
     # Send an email using Boto3 (Python SDK)
     import boto3

     client = boto3.client('ses', region_name='us-west-2')
     response = client.send_email(
         Source='sender@example.com',
         Destination={
             'ToAddresses': [
                 'recipient@example.com',
             ],
         },
         Message={
             'Subject': {
                 'Data': 'Test Email',
             },
             'Body': {
                 'Text': {
                     'Data': 'Hello, this is a test email.',
                 },

         },
     )
     print(response)
     ```

     - **Email Receiving Endpoint:** SES handles incoming emails for configured domains.
   - **Use Case:** A support system receives and processes customer support emails and stores them in an S3 bucket.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges based on the number of incoming emails and data storage in S3.
   - **Commands and Code:**
     ```bash
     # Create a receipt rule set using AWS CLI
     aws ses create-receipt-rule-set --rule-set-name MyRuleSet
     aws ses create-receipt-rule --rule-set-name MyRuleSet --rule Name=MyRule,Recipients=example.com,Actions=[{S3Action={BucketName=my-s3-bucket}}]
     ```

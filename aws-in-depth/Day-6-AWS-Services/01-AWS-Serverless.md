# AWS Serverless

AWS Serverless services allow you to build and run applications without managing servers. With serverless computing, you can focus on writing code and configuring services, while AWS handles the infrastructure management. 

## AWS Serverless Architecture
The AWS Serverless architecture includes several key components that work together to build scalable and resilient applications:

### 1. AWS Lambda
   - **Description:** AWS Lambda is a Event driven compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda functions in response to various events such as changes in data, system state, or user actions.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Event Sources:** AWS Lambda can be triggered by events from services like S3, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, and API Gateway.
     - **Execution Environment:** Executes your code in a managed environment with resources like memory, CPU, and temporary storage.
   - **Use Case:** A company wants to process uploaded images in real-time. AWS Lambda can be triggered by S3 events to process images and store results in a database.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of requests and the duration of code execution. Costs include memory allocation, execution time, and the number of requests.
   - **Commands:**
```bash
     # Create a Lambda function
     aws lambda create-function --function-name MyFunction --runtime nodejs14.x --role arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/lambda-role --handler index.handler --zip-file fileb://function.zip

     # Invoke a Lambda function
     aws lambda invoke --function-name MyFunction output.json
  ```

### 2. Amazon API Gateway
   - **Description:** Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service for creating and publishing APIs. It provides a front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from backend services.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **API Methods:** Define HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and their integration with backend services.
     - **Stages:** Manage different versions of your API (e.g., development, staging, production).
   - **Use Case:** An e-commerce platform uses API Gateway to expose RESTful APIs for its services, allowing users to place orders, check inventory, and manage accounts.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of API calls, data transferred out, and the number of messages transferred between API Gateway and AWS Lambda.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create an API
     aws apigateway create-rest-api --name MyAPI

     # Deploy an API
     aws apigateway create-deployment --rest-api-id <api-id> --stage-name prod
     ```

### 3. Amazon DynamoDB
   - **Description:** Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Tables:** Stores data in tables with primary keys and optionally secondary indexes.
     - **Streams:** Capture changes to data in tables and trigger AWS Lambda functions.
   - **Use Case:** A mobile app uses DynamoDB to store user data and application state, ensuring high availability and low-latency access.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on read and write capacity units, storage consumed, and optional features like DynamoDB Streams.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a DynamoDB table
     aws dynamodb create-table --table-name MyTable --attribute-definitions AttributeName=Id,AttributeType=N --key-schema AttributeName=Id,KeyType=HASH --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5

     # Query a DynamoDB table
     aws dynamodb query --table-name MyTable --key-condition-expression "Id = :id" --expression-attribute-values '{":id": {"N": "123"}}'
     ```

### 4. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
   - **Description:** Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers scalable storage with high availability and durability. It is used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Buckets:** Containers for storing objects.
     - **Objects:** Data stored in S3 with metadata and access policies.
   - **Use Case:** A media company uses S3 to store and serve large volumes of images and videos, leveraging features like versioning and lifecycle policies.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the amount of data stored, data transfer, and requests made to S3 (e.g., GET and PUT requests).
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Upload a file to S3
     aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/myfile.txt

     # List objects in a bucket
     aws s3 ls s3://mybucket
     ```

### 5. AWS Step Functions
   - **Description:** AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. It allows you to build and run complex workflows using visual representations.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **State Machines:** Define the workflow of tasks and their dependencies.
     - **Tasks:** Actions performed by AWS services or Lambda functions.
   - **Use Case:** An organization uses Step Functions to automate a data processing pipeline, orchestrating Lambda functions and DynamoDB updates.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of state transitions and the execution duration of workflows.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a Step Function state machine
     aws stepfunctions create-state-machine --name MyStateMachine --definition file://state-machine-definition.json --role-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/stepfunctions-role

     # Start an execution
     aws stepfunctions start-execution --state-machine-arn <state-machine-arn> --name MyExecution --input '{"key": "value"}'
     ```

### 6. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)
   - **Description:** Amazon SNS is a fully managed service that allows you to send messages to a large number of recipients. It supports multiple protocols, including SMS, email, and HTTP/S.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Topics:** Logical channels for sending messages.
     - **Subscriptions:** Endpoints that receive messages published to topics.
   - **Use Case:** A news organization uses SNS to send real-time alerts and notifications to subscribers about breaking news events.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of messages published, delivery attempts, and message size.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create an SNS topic
     aws sns create-topic --name MyTopic

     # Publish a message to an SNS topic
     aws sns publish --topic-arn <topic-arn> --message "This is a test message"
     ```

### 7. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
   - **Description:** Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Queues:** Store and manage messages until they are processed.
     - **Messages:** Data sent between components of an application.
   - **Use Case:** An e-commerce platform uses SQS to handle order processing by queuing incoming orders and processing them asynchronously.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of requests and the amount of data transferred.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create an SQS queue
     aws sqs create-queue --queue-name MyQueue

     # Send a message to an SQS queue
     aws sqs send-message --queue-url <queue-url> --message-body "This is a test message"
     ```

### 8. Amazon CloudFront
   - **Description:** Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that delivers content with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches copies of your content at edge locations around the world.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Distributions:** Define how CloudFront serves your content (e.g., from S3 or an HTTP server).
     - **Edge Locations:** Data centers around the world that cache and deliver content.
   - **Use Case:** A video streaming service uses CloudFront to deliver high-definition video content to users globally, ensuring fast and reliable streaming.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the amount of data transferred and the number of requests.
   - **Commands:**

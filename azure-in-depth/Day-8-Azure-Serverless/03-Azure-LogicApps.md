# Azure Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you automate workflows and integrate apps, data, and services across enterprises or organizations. It provides a way to build automated workflows with a visual designer, enabling you to integrate different services and systems seamlessly.

## Azure Logic Apps Architecture

Azure Logic Apps architecture consists of several key components that work together to enable workflow automation:

### 1. Logic App
   - **Description:** The core component where you define the automated workflows. A Logic App consists of a series of steps or actions that are triggered by an event.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Workflow Definition:** Workflows are defined using a visual designer or JSON code, specifying the actions to be performed and their order.
     - **Triggers and Actions:** Logic Apps use triggers to start workflows and actions to perform tasks within the workflow.
   - **Use Case:** Automating the process of sending notifications when a new item is added to a SharePoint list.
   - **Billing Details:** Costs are based on the number of workflow runs and the number of actions executed.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a new Logic App
     az logic workflow create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <LogicAppName> --definition <WorkflowDefinitionFile>
     ```

### 2. Triggers
   - **Description:** Triggers are events that start the execution of a Logic App. They define the conditions under which the workflow should be initiated.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Types of Triggers:** Various triggers such as HTTP requests, timers, and service-based triggers (e.g., when a new email arrives).
   - **Use Case:** A timer trigger that initiates a workflow every day at midnight to generate and send a daily report.
   - **Billing Details:** Trigger usage is included in the overall billing for Logic Apps. Charges are based on the number of times triggers are executed.
   - **Commands:**
     ```json
     {
       "type": "Http",
       "kind": "Webhook",
       "inputs": {
         "method": "POST",
         "uri": "<WebhookUrl>"
       }
     }
     ```

### 3. Actions
   - **Description:** Actions are tasks performed as part of a Logic App workflow. They are executed sequentially after the trigger event.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Types of Actions:** Includes built-in actions (e.g., send email, HTTP requests) and connectors to various services (e.g., SQL Server, Office 365).
   - **Use Case:** Sending an email with details of a new order to a sales team when an order is placed in an e-commerce system.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are incurred based on the number of actions executed in the workflow.
   - **Commands:**
     ```json
     {
       "type": "SendEmail",
       "inputs": {
         "to": "example@example.com",
         "subject": "Order Confirmation",
         "body": "Your order has been placed successfully."
       }
     }
     ```

### 4. Connectors
   - **Description:** Connectors allow Logic Apps to interact with various external services and systems, such as databases, APIs, and other SaaS applications.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Types of Connectors:** Includes built-in connectors (e.g., Azure Storage, Salesforce) and custom connectors that you define.
   - **Use Case:** Using a SQL Server connector to query a database and then send the results to a team via email.
   - **Billing Details:** Usage of connectors is included in the overall billing for Logic Apps. Charges are based on the number of operations performed with connectors.
   - **Commands:**
     ```json
     {
       "type": "SqlServer",
       "inputs": {
         "connection": {
           "name": "SqlServerConnection"
         },
         "method": "ExecuteQuery",
         "parameters": {
           "query": "SELECT * FROM Orders"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

### 5. Run History
   - **Description:** Provides a record of the execution of a Logic App, including details of successful runs and errors.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Monitoring:** Access detailed logs and metrics to monitor the performance and diagnose issues.
   - **Use Case:** Reviewing run history to troubleshoot failed executions or to analyse performance trends.
   - **Billing Details:** Run history storage is included in the overall billing. Charges are based on the volume of data and retention duration.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # List run history
     az logic workflow run list --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <LogicAppName>
     ```

### 6. Integration Accounts (Optional)
   - **Description:** Provides additional capabilities for advanced scenarios, such as B2B integration, including support for enterprise integration packs and EDI.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Features:** Includes support for XML processing, EDI agreements, and schema validation.
   - **Use Case:** Integrating with a partnerâ€™s EDI system for automated invoice processing.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the features and usage of the integration account.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create an Integration Account
     az logic integration-account create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <IntegrationAccountName> --location <Location>
     ```

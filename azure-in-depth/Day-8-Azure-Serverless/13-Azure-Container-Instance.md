# Azure Container Instances (ACI)

Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a service that allows you to run containers in Azure without managing virtual machines or having to learn new tools. It is a cost-effective and flexible solution for running single-container or multiple-container applications quickly and efficiently.

## Use Case

- Sometimes we have containerized workloads that require us to permanently run containers. There could be a website or a database in a container that needs to be continuously running. However, long-running containers are not cost-effective to host on Azure Container Instance because they end up costing twice as much as just hosting in a virtual machine.

- Suppose I want to perform a continuous integration build using a Docker container and a build happens every time I push code to my central repository. If my build takes 10 minutes and if I commit code twice daily on weekdays, it means I am going to do 40 builds and take a total of 400 minutes. So if I want to allocate a build container that has 4 GB of RAM and 2 core then 400 minutes with ACI would only cost me around ₹ 68 approximately. But if I use a virtual machine for the same, it would cost me around ₹ 3740 approximately. And in fact, the virtual machine would sit idle for most of the time. So, despite costing more for continuously running containers, ACI can actually save a lot of money compare to virtual machines. This is very common when you are developing software to run small short-lived experiments. If you want to get a test instance of something running in the cloud, with ACI, you can quickly spin up a container, do your testing and then delete it when you are done. And here, you will have to only pay for a few hours of usage.

- You can also use Azure Container Instances for batch jobs where you have a container image that has to process the jobs in your batch like media transcoding. Apart from all this, there are chances that your workload is sometimes highly variable. Probably the incoming traffic to a website might be extremely high or you might have to upload large amounts of data overnight. One way it is possible to scale your cluster up is by adding extra virtual machines. But the other way and the better one is to use ACI to elastically handle bursts of load without you needing to provide any type of extra hardware. You can say that Azure Container Instances might not be the right fit for every type of containerized workload but they can be the best option there is when you need to run short-lived containers to handle occasional workloads or high bursts of additional work.

## ACI Architecture

Azure Container Instances architecture is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to run containers without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. Here are the key components:

### 1. Containers
   - **Description:** Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Single Container Group:** A single instance of a container that runs an application.
     - **Multiple Container Group:** A group of containers that share the same lifecycle, network, and storage.
   - **Use Case:** A microservice application that requires multiple containers to communicate within a single container group.
   - **Billing Details:** Costs are based on the number of CPU cores and memory allocated to the container instances, as well as the duration they run.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a single container instance
     az container create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <ContainerName> --image <ImageName> --cpu 1 --memory 1.5

     # List all container instances
     az container list --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --output table
     ```

### 2. Container Groups
   - **Description:** A container group is a collection of containers that share the same lifecycle, network resources, and storage volumes. It is the top-level resource in Azure Container Instances.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Networking:** Each container group gets its own IP address and DNS name, allowing external access.
     - **Storage:** Can mount Azure file shares as volumes for persistent storage.
   - **Use Case:** A containerized web application with a front-end and back-end service running in separate containers within the same container group.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges based on the combined CPU and memory of all containers in the group and the duration they run.
   - **YAML Code:**
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: 2018-10-01
     location: eastus
     properties:
       containers:
       - name: frontend
         properties:
           image: myfrontend:latest
           resources:
             requests:
               cpu: 1
               memoryInGB: 1.5
       - name: backend
         properties:
           image: mybackend:latest
           resources:
             requests:
               cpu: 1
               memoryInGB: 1.5
       osType: Linux
     ```

### 3. Networking
   - **Description:** Networking in Azure Container Instances allows you to expose containers to the internet or keep them private within a virtual network.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Public IP Address:** Containers can be assigned a public IP address for direct access.
     - **Virtual Network Integration:** ACI can join a virtual network to access resources securely.
   - **Use Case:** Deploy a REST API that needs to be accessible over the internet via a public IP address.
   - **Billing Details:** Costs for networking depend on data transfer rates, especially for outbound data.
   - **YAML Code:**
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: 2018-10-01
     location: eastus
     properties:
       containers:
       - name: myapi
         properties:
           image: myapi:latest
           resources:
             requests:
               cpu: 1
               memoryInGB: 1
           ports:
           - port: 80
       osType: Linux
       ipAddress:
         type: Public
         ports:
         - protocol: tcp
           port: 80
     ```

### 4. Storage
   - **Description:** ACI allows containers to use Azure Files to provide persistent storage. This storage is shared between containers in a group.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Azure File Share:** Can be mounted as volumes in containers for persistent storage.
     - **Environment Variables:** Used to pass configuration details, such as connection strings, to containers.
   - **Use Case:** An application that processes files and needs to store the output data persistently.
   - **Billing Details:** Storage costs depend on the type and amount of Azure Files storage used.
   - **YAML Code:**
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: 2018-10-01
     location: eastus
     properties:
       containers:
       - name: fileprocessor
         properties:
           image: fileprocessor:latest
           resources:
             requests:
               cpu: 1
               memoryInGB: 1
           volumeMounts:
           - mountPath: /mnt/data
             name: myvolume
       osType: Linux
       volumes:
       - name: myvolume
         azureFile:
           shareName: myfileshare
           storageAccountName: mystorageaccount
           storageAccountKey: <storage-account-key>
     ```

### 5. Security and Compliance
   - **Description:** ACI provides security features to isolate containers and protect data, including managed identity integration and secure network configurations.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Managed Identity:** Allows containers to access Azure resources securely without storing credentials.
     - **Network Security:** Use of Azure Virtual Network to restrict access.
   - **Use Case:** A financial application that processes sensitive data and requires secure access to Azure SQL Database using managed identities.
   - **Billing Details:** No additional costs for using managed identities, but associated Azure resources may incur costs.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Enable a system-assigned managed identity for a container group
     az container create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <ContainerName> --image <ImageName> --assign-identity
     ```

## Use Cases of Azure Container Instances

1. **Batch Processing Jobs**
   - **Scenario:** A company needs to process large datasets periodically without maintaining dedicated infrastructure.
   - **Solution:** Use ACI to spin up containers for batch processing jobs. This enables on-demand scaling and only incurs costs when jobs are running.

2. **Development and Testing**
   - **Scenario:** A development team needs isolated environments to test different versions of their application.
   - **Solution:** Deploy containers in ACI for each version, allowing quick and easy environment setup and teardown.

3. **Event-Driven Applications**
   - **Scenario:** A service needs to handle occasional bursts of traffic or data processing.
   - **Solution:** Utilize ACI to run containers in response to events (e.g., via Azure Functions), scaling out the workload dynamically.

4. **Microservices Architecture**
   - **Scenario:** Deploy and manage a microservices-based application.
   - **Solution:** Run each microservice in its container within ACI, leveraging container groups to manage service interdependencies.

# Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets, keys, and certificates. It helps protect cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services.

## Key Components of Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault consists of several core components that enable secure management of sensitive data:

### 1. Secrets

- **Description:** Secrets are arbitrary key-value pairs that store confidential information such as passwords, connection strings, or API keys.
- **Architecture:** 
  - **Secret Management:** Secrets are stored securely and can be accessed programmatically or through the Azure Portal.
- **Use Case:** An application needs to access a third-party API securely. The API key is stored in Azure Key Vault as a secret, and the application retrieves it at runtime.
- **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of secrets stored and operations performed (e.g., retrievals and updates).

- **Commands:**
```bash
  # Create a new secret
  az keyvault secret set --vault-name <VaultName> --name <SecretName> --value <SecretValue>

  # Retrieve a secret
  az keyvault secret show --vault-name <VaultName> --name <SecretName>
```

### 2. Keys

- **Description:** Keys are cryptographic keys used for encryption, decryption, signing, and key management operations.
- **Architecture:** 
- **Key Types:** RSA and Elliptic Curve keys are supported.
- **Key Management:** Supports key rotation, import, and generation.
- **Use Case:** A financial application encrypts sensitive transaction data using an RSA key stored in Azure Key Vault.
- **Billing Details:** Charges depend on the number of keys, operations performed, and key types (e.g., RSA, EC).

- **Commands:**
```bash
# Create a new key
az keyvault key create --vault-name <VaultName> --name <KeyName> --kty RSA

# Retrieve a key
az keyvault key show --vault-name <VaultName> --name <KeyName>

```

### 2. Certificates

- **Description:** Certificates are used to manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication and authentication.
- **Architecture:** 
- **Certificate Management:** Supports certificate creation, renewal, import, and policy management.
- **Use Case:** A web application uses an SSL/TLS certificate stored in Azure Key Vault to secure communications between the client and server.
- **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of certificates stored and operations performed.

- **Commands:**
```bash
# Create a certificate
az keyvault certificate create --vault-name <VaultName> --name <CertName> --policy @policy.json

# Retrieve a certificate
az keyvault certificate show --vault-name <VaultName> --name <CertName>

```
## Use Cases of Azure Key Vault

## Secure Configuration Management

- **Scenario:** An enterprise application requires secure access to configuration data, such as database connection strings.
- **Solution:** Store the configuration data as secrets in Azure Key Vault and retrieve them securely at runtime.

## Automated Certificate Management

- **Scenario:** A company wants to automate the management of SSL certificates for its web services.
- **Solution:** Use Azure Key Vault to store, renew, and manage SSL certificates, reducing manual effort and minimizing downtime.

## Key Management for Encryption

- **Scenario:** A healthcare organization needs to encrypt patient data for compliance with data protection regulations.
- **Solution:** Store encryption keys in Azure Key Vault, enabling secure key management and rotation.

## Integration with Azure Services

- **Scenario:** An Azure Function app needs to access secrets for an external API securely.
- **Solution:** Use Azure Key Vault to manage secrets and configure the Function app with appropriate access policies.

# Billing Details

## Cost Factors

1. **Vault Charges:** Charges are based on the number of key vaults and operations performed.
2. **Secrets:** Costs depend on the number of secrets stored and accessed.
3. **Keys:** Charges for key creation, import, rotation, and cryptographic operations.
4. **Certificates:** Costs for certificate storage and operations like issuance and renewal.

## Pricing Tiers

- **Standard Pricing:** Includes basic operations and storage charges.
- **Premium Features:** Additional charges for features like HSM-protected keys and higher operation limits.

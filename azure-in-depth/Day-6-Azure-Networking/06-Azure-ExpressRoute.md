## Setting Up Azure ExpressRoute

### Steps to Configure Azure ExpressRoute

1. **Create an ExpressRoute Circuit:**

   - **Navigate to the Azure Portal:**
     - Go to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "ExpressRoute".
     - Click "Create" to start the ExpressRoute circuit creation process.

   - **Configure Circuit Details:**
     - Provide a name for the circuit, select the service provider, and specify the SKU (Standard or Premium).
     - Enter the desired bandwidth and the location of the ExpressRoute peering.

   - **Review and Create:**
     - Review the configuration and click "Create" to provision the ExpressRoute circuit.

2. **Configure the ExpressRoute Circuit with Your Service Provider:**

   - **Work with Your Provider:**
     - After creating the circuit, you need to work with your service provider to set up the physical connection.
     - Provide the service provider with the ExpressRoute circuit details and configuration information.

   - **Set Up the Physical Connection:**
     - The service provider will establish a physical connection between your on-premises data centre and the Azure data centre.

3. **Create a Virtual Network Gateway:**

   - **Navigate to the Azure Portal:**
     - Go to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Virtual Network Gateway".
     - Click "Create" and configure the gateway settings.

   - **Select the ExpressRoute Circuit:**
     - Choose the VNet where you want to use ExpressRoute and select the previously created ExpressRoute circuit.

   - **Review and Create:**
     - Review the configuration and click "Create" to provision the Virtual Network Gateway.

4. **Configure Peering:**

   - **Private Peering:**
     - Set up private peering to connect your on-premises network to Azure VNets. Configure the peering settings including address spaces and routing.

   - **Microsoft Peering (Optional):**
     - If you require access to Azure PaaS services, configure Microsoft peering.

   - **Public Peering (Deprecated):**
     - Note that public peering is no longer available. Use Microsoft peering for accessing Azure services.

5. **Verify and Test Connectivity:**

   - **Check Connection Status:**
     - In the Azure Portal, verify that the ExpressRoute circuit and Virtual Network Gateway are properly connected.

   - **Test Connectivity:**
     - Test the connection to ensure that data flows between your on-premises network and Azure as expected.

6. **Monitor and Manage:**

   - **Monitor Performance:**
     - Use Azure Monitor and Network Watcher to keep track of performance metrics and health.

   - **Manage Circuit:**
     - Regularly review and manage the ExpressRoute circuit configuration and usage.

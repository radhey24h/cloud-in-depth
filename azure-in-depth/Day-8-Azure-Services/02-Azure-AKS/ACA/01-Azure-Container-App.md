# Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps is a serverless container hosting service that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a fully managed platform. It provides features like automatic scaling, integrated monitoring, and easy deployment, supporting both stateless and stateful applications.

## Azure Container Apps Architecture

Azure Container Apps architecture consists of several components that work together to host and manage containerized applications:

### 1. Container App Environment
   - **Description:** A logical container for hosting one or more container apps. It provides networking and compute resources shared among the apps.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Virtual Network Integration:** Allows the environment to connect to other Azure services and resources within a virtual network.
     - **Managed Infrastructure:** Azure automatically manages the underlying infrastructure, providing scalability and availability.
   - **Use Case:** A company deploys multiple microservices within a single Container App Environment, allowing them to share resources and communicate over a private network.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the compute and networking resources used within the environment.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Create a Container App Environment
     az containerapp env create --name <EnvironmentName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --location <Location>
     ```

### 2. Container Apps
   - **Description:** A containerized application running within a Container App Environment. Each app can consist of one or more containers.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Containers:** Run inside the app with defined CPU and memory resources.
     - **Revisions:** Container apps can have multiple revisions, allowing updates and rollbacks.
   - **Use Case:** An e-commerce platform runs separate container apps for the frontend, backend, and payment processing services.
   - **Billing Details:** Costs depend on the CPU and memory resources allocated to each container app and its revisions.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Deploy a Container App
     az containerapp create --name <AppName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --environment <EnvironmentName> --image <ImageName>
     ```

### 3. Traffic Management
   - **Description:** Controls how traffic is distributed among the different revisions of a container app.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Revision Weighting:** Allows distributing traffic based on specified weights to different revisions.
     - **Automatic Routing:** Azure routes incoming requests to the appropriate container based on the configuration.
   - **Use Case:** A new version of a microservice is deployed, and 10% of the traffic is directed to it for canary testing while the rest goes to the stable version.
   - **Billing Details:** No additional charges for traffic management; costs are part of the overall Container App billing.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Set traffic distribution for a Container App
     az containerapp revision set-mode --name <AppName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --mode multiple
     ```

### 4. Autoscaling
   - **Description:** Automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on demand or specified criteria.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Horizontal Scaling:** Increases or decreases the number of instances based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics.
   - **Use Case:** An online service experiences varying traffic patterns. Autoscaling ensures sufficient resources during peak times and cost efficiency during low demand.
   - **Billing Details:** Charges are based on the number of running instances and the resources allocated to each.
   - **YAML Code:**
     ```yaml
     # Autoscale configuration
     kind: ContainerApp
     apiVersion: v1
     metadata:
       name: my-container-app
     spec:
       scale:
         minReplicas: 1
         maxReplicas: 10
         rules:
         - name: http-rule
           http:
             metadata:
               concurrentRequests: "50"
     ```

### 5. Managed Identity
   - **Description:** Provides secure access to Azure resources without managing credentials. Container Apps can use managed identities to authenticate to Azure services.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **System-Assigned Identity:** Automatically created and managed by Azure for the app.
     - **User-Assigned Identity:** Managed separately and can be shared among multiple apps.
   - **Use Case:** A container app accesses a Key Vault to retrieve secrets without storing credentials in the application code.
   - **Billing Details:** No additional costs for using managed identities.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Enable managed identity for a Container App
     az containerapp identity assign --name <AppName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --identity [system|user]
     ```

### 6. Logging and Monitoring
   - **Description:** Provides insights into application performance and operational health through integrated logging and monitoring tools.
   - **Architecture:** 
     - **Azure Monitor:** Collects and analyzes logs and metrics.
     - **Log Analytics Workspace:** Stores and queries logs.
   - **Use Case:** DevOps teams monitor application performance and diagnose issues using real-time metrics and logs.
   - **Billing Details:** Costs are based on the volume of logs and metrics collected and stored.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     # Enable logging for a Container App
     az monitor log-analytics workspace create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --workspace-name <WorkspaceName>

     # Link Log Analytics to Container App
     az containerapp update --name <AppName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --logs-workspace-id <WorkspaceId>
     ```

## Billing Details

### Cost Factors

1. **Compute Resources:** Charges are based on the CPU and memory resources used by each container app.
2. **Networking:** Costs for data transfer between container apps and external services, as well as virtual network integration.
3. **Storage:** Charges for any persistent storage used by container apps.
4. **Additional Services:** Costs for logging, monitoring, and other integrated services.

### Pricing Tiers

- **Standard Pricing:** Includes the basic costs for compute, networking, and storage resources.
- **Premium Features:** Additional charges for enhanced networking, scaling options, and integration with other Azure services.

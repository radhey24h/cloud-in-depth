# Cloud Computing Concepts

## Scalability vs. Elasticity

### Scalability

- **Definition**: Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing workload by proportionally increasing its resource capacity.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Proportional Growth**: Resources are added in proportion to the demand.
  - **Handling Increased Traffic**: Scales up to accommodate higher traffic or workload.

### Elasticity

- **Definition**: Elasticity refers to the capability of a system to dynamically commission and decommission resources as needed.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Dynamic Adjustment**: Resources are adjusted in real-time based on current demand.
  - **Cost-Efficiency**: Ensures optimal resource usage by scaling resources up or down as required.

## Cloud Design Patterns

A cloud design pattern is a reusable solution to common problems encountered in cloud computing. Here are some key patterns:

- **Ambassador**: Offloads common client connectivity tasks (e.g., monitoring, logging, routing, security) in a language-agnostic manner.
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Provides a fa√ßade between new and legacy systems to prevent dependencies on outdated systems.
- **Backends for Frontends**: Creates separate backend services for different types of clients (e.g., desktop vs. mobile) to handle specific client needs efficiently.
- **Bulkhead**: Isolates critical resources (e.g., connection pool, memory, CPU) to prevent one service from consuming all resources and affecting others, enhancing resiliency.
- **Gateway Aggregation**: Aggregates requests to multiple microservices into a single request to reduce chattiness.
- **Gateway Offloading**: Allows microservices to offload shared functionalities (e.g., SSL certificates) to an API gateway.
- **Gateway Routing**: Routes requests to multiple microservices using a single endpoint, simplifying endpoint management.
- **Sidecar**: Deploys helper components as separate containers or processes for isolation and encapsulation.
- **Strangler**: Supports incremental migration by gradually replacing pieces of functionality with new services.

## What is Serverless?

- **Definition**: Serverless computing allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing underlying servers or infrastructure. The cloud provider handles resource allocation, scaling, and operational aspects.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Focus on Code**: Developers focus on writing code and defining functionality.
  - **Managed Infrastructure**: The cloud provider manages resource allocation and scaling.

### Advantages of Serverless Computing

- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the execution time and resources used.
- **Simplified Operations**: Reduces the need for server management.
- **Increased Productivity**: Developers can concentrate on code and functionality.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Scales resources automatically based on demand.
- **No Server Management**: No need to manage the underlying servers.

### Disadvantages of Serverless Computing

- **Response Latency**: Potential for latency due to cold starts or resource allocation delays.
- **Resource Limitations**: Not ideal for high-computing operations due to resource constraints.
- **Security Responsibility**: Security responsibilities lie with the service provider, which might be a concern.
- **Debugging Challenges**: Debugging serverless code can be more complex.

## What is VPN?

- **Definition**: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a technology that secures data transmission over a public network by creating a private network.
- **Purpose**: VPN allows secure communication in cloud environments and can transform a public network into a private one.

## Top Security Concerns in Cloud Computing

1. **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
2. **Hijacking of Accounts**: Unauthorized access to user accounts.
3. **Insider Threats**: Security risks from within the organization.
4. **Malware Injection**: Introduction of malicious software.
5. **Abuse of Cloud Services**: Misuse of cloud resources.
6. **Insecure APIs**: Vulnerabilities in application programming interfaces.

## What is Cloud Computing?
Before knowing cloud computing let us understand what is computer and what is computing?

- **Computer**: A computer is a device that processes data according to set of instruction. It can perform various tasks such as calculations, data storage, and communication.

- **Computing**: Computing refers to the use of computers, It includes everything from basic tasks like data entry and word processing to complex processes like software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

## how many computing models is available?

### 1. Desktop Computing Model
- **Definition**: Traditional model with dedicated desktop computers. 
When we talk about standalone PC, it is called desktop computing model, desktop computing model was the first cmputing model in IT industry.
This model is also famous today because we run this model to complete our day to day task.
- **Benefits**: Personalization, full control over resources.
- **Drawbacks**: Limited scalability, high maintenance costs and not able to run remotelly it becomes just a device to manage some personal work.
- **Use Case**: Small offices or personal computing.

### 2. Client-Server Computing Model

### what all type of costs came in piture to manage server?
- **Copex** Capital expenditure refers to the funds a company spends on acquiring, upgrading, or maintaining physical assets such as buildings, equipment, or infrastructure. These expenditures are typically one-time investments that are expected to generate benefits over a long period. Examples include purchasing servers,  or investing in machinery.
- **Opex** Operational expenditure, on the other hand, refers to the ongoing costs that a business incurs to maintain its daily operations. These expenses are necessary for running the business and usually recur regularly. Examples include salaries, rent, utilities, maintenance contracts, and consumables.
- **Use Case**: Research collaborations, large-scale computations.

### 5. Cloud Computing Model
Now to avoid these major problem of grid computing model, a new concept came from **NIST** 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a framework for understanding and adopting cloud computing, hardwares and softwares. 

So NIST provides a provision if anyone want to rent-out the free space of their server and earn some money they can.
From here the cloud computing concept came in picture.

## What is Cloud Computing?
In simpler terms, imagine cloud is an virtual space where you can store files, run software, and access various services over the internet.

Cloud computing is like using a remote computer over the internet to store and manage your data or run applications. Instead of storing files or running software on your local computer, you can access them through the internet from a provider's server (the "cloud"). It allows you to use resources like storage space or software without needing to own or manage the physical infrastructure yourself.

# Other Cloud Computing terminology

## Scalability vs. Elasticity

## Scalability

- **Definition**: Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing workload by proportionally increasing its resource capacity.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Proportional Growth**: Resources are added in proportion to the demand.
  - **Handling Increased Traffic**: Scales up to accommodate higher traffic or workload.

## Elasticity

- **Definition**: Elasticity refers to the capability of a system to dynamically commission and decommission resources as needed.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Dynamic Adjustment**: Resources are adjusted in real-time based on current demand.
  - **Cost-Efficiency**: Ensures optimal resource usage by scaling resources up or down as required.

## Agility
Agility in cloud computing means being able to make changes quickly and easily. 
**Use-Case:** It's like being able to rearrange your furniture instantly to make room for guests. In the cloud, this means deploying new applications, scaling resources, or making updates rapidly, allowing businesses to respond to market demands and opportunities more effectively.

## High Availability
High availability in cloud computing means that a system or service is always up and running, even if something goes wrong. **Use-Case:** Imagine a store that never closes, even if one entrance is blocked; customers can still get in through another door. In the cloud, this means that your data and applications remain accessible, with backup systems ready to take over if there's an issue.

## Fault Tolerance
Fault tolerance in cloud computing means that a system can keep working even if some parts fail. Think of it like a car with extra tires that automatically replace a flat tire while you’re driving, so you don’t have to stop. This ensures that services remain available and reliable, even when issues occur.

Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating in the event of hardware or software failures. It involves designing systems with redundancy and failover mechanisms to mitigate the impact of failures on overall system performance and availability.

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery refers to the process and procedures for recovering and restoring data, applications, and infrastructure in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. It includes backup strategies, replication of data across geographically diverse locations, and comprehensive recovery plans.

## Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources in a balanced manner. It ensures optimal resource utilization, improves responsiveness, and prevents any single server from being overwhelmed by distributing workloads effectively.


## Cloud Design Patterns

A cloud design pattern is a reusable solution to common problems encountered in cloud computing. Here are some key patterns:

- **Ambassador**: Offloads common client connectivity tasks (e.g., monitoring, logging, routing, security) in a language-agnostic manner.
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Provides a façade between new and legacy systems to prevent dependencies on outdated systems.
- **Backends for Frontends**: Creates separate backend services for different types of clients (e.g., desktop vs. mobile) to handle specific client needs efficiently.
- **Bulkhead**: Isolates critical resources (e.g., connection pool, memory, CPU) to prevent one service from consuming all resources and affecting others, enhancing resiliency.
- **Gateway Aggregation**: Aggregates requests to multiple microservices into a single request to reduce chattiness.
- **Gateway Offloading**: Allows microservices to offload shared functionalities (e.g., SSL certificates) to an API gateway.
- **Gateway Routing**: Routes requests to multiple microservices using a single endpoint, simplifying endpoint management.
- **Sidecar**: Deploys helper components as separate containers or processes for isolation and encapsulation.
- **Strangler**: Supports incremental migration by gradually replacing pieces of functionality with new services.

## What is Serverless?

- **Definition**: Serverless computing allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing underlying servers or infrastructure. The cloud provider handles resource allocation, scaling, and operational aspects.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Focus on Code**: Developers focus on writing code and defining functionality.

## Azure Account, Subscription, and Resource Group Hierarchy Explained

### Azure Account
An Azure Account is the top-level entity that represents your access to Azure services. It is associated with a unique email address and acts as a container for all your Azure resources. When you sign up for Azure, you create an Azure Account.

### Subscription
Within an Azure Account, you can have one or more Subscriptions. A Subscription is a logical unit that provides access to Azure services and resources. It is associated with a specific billing and payment plan. Each Subscription has its own resource limits and usage quotas. You can think of a Subscription as a way to organize and manage your Azure resources based on different projects, departments, or environments.

### Resource Group
Inside a Subscription, you can create one or more Resource Groups. A Resource Group is a logical container that holds related Azure resources. It helps you organize and manage resources based on their lifecycle, ownership, or purpose. For example, you might have a Resource Group for a web application that contains virtual machines, storage accounts, and a database.

### Resource Groups provide several benefits:
- They enable you to manage and monitor resources collectively.
  They allow you to apply consistent policies and permissions to a group of resources.
  They provide a way to organize resources based on their lifecycle, such as deleting all resources in a Resource Group when they are no longer needed.
  It's important to note that resources within a Resource Group must be in the same Azure region.

- To summarize, the hierarchy is as follows: An Azure Account can have multiple Subscriptions, and each Subscription can have multiple Resource Groups. Resource Groups, in turn, contain the actual Azure resources like virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, etc.

### Azure Resources
Any manageable item in Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, or web apps.

## Manage subscription
### Subscription 
subscription allows us to use a service based on a fee. It allow us to use the service on an on-demand basis, and they ask for payment monthly basis and also they only ask what-ever service we have used.
After creating an account on azure portal we get 
1) Free trail and 
2) Azure Active directory

Without subscription we can't create any resource.

There are different types of subscriptions.
1) Free trail
2) visual studio yearly subscription: where we get visual studio free credits every month
3) Pay as you go :

## Subscription permission level
When we create an azure account, we get three level of permission in azure.
1) **Account Administrator**: When we create an azure account we get 1 Account Administrator Per account.
It manage all the subscription in an account
It create new subscription
it can cancel subscription
He can change the billing for a subscription
He can change the service administrator.

2) **Service administrator**: When we create an subscription, we can get 1 Service Administrator Per subscription.
Manage services in azure portal
Assign users to the co-Administrator role.

2) **Co-Administrator**: When we create an subscription service Administrator can create 200 co-Administrator role the access will be same like service administrator but he can't change the role of Service administrator.

## Management group
when we create multiple subscription we use management group to manage multiple subscription.
We can go Management group and we can add multiple subscription for multiple company.

Now let us say you have a product company and it is growing very well after a certain duration you acquire your competitor and he is also running an azure account so we can transfer that subscription one account.
**Benefits of Management group**
using Management group we can manage company(Management group) level cost and azure policy(like change wallpaper or change password).

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- **Definition**: Management layer for deploying and managing Azure resources.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies resource deployment, ensures consistent management.
- **Drawbacks**: Learning curve for complex deployments.

## Components of Azure Architecture

### Data centres
A data center is like a big, secure building full of powerful computers and storage devices. It keeps all kinds of information safe and available so that people and businesses can access it whenever they need it. 

### Regions
Azure divides the world into regions, much like how continents divide the Earth. Each region contains multiple data centres. These regions help Azure users choose where they want their data and applications to be located for optimal performance and compliance with local laws.
**Example**: Similar to how different countries have their own rules and regulations, Azure regions ensure that data stays within legal boundaries and operates efficiently across the globe.

### Availability Zones
Within each region, there are availability zones, similar to neighbourhoods in a city. Each zone has its own infrastructure, providing redundancy and ensuring high availability of services.

Availability zones provide redundancy and ensure that if one zone goes down (due to maintenance or other issues), the services in other zones remain unaffected.

Availability Zones in Azure are physically separate locations within an Azure region with independent power, cooling, and networking.

#### Benefits
- **High Availability**: Redundancy across Availability Zones minimizes downtime.
- **Data Residency**: Compliance with data residency and sovereignty requirements.

### Resources
Azure offers various resources that users can use to build and run their applications. These include virtual machines (VMs), storage accounts, databases, and networking capabilities. Resources are the fundamental building blocks you use to create your digital services in Azure.

### Services
Azure provides a wide range of services that users can integrate into their applications. These services include computing power (to run programs), storage solutions (to store data), databases (to manage information), and networking tools (to connect different parts of an application). These services help developers build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently.

**Example**: Services in Azure are like tools in a toolbox. Just as a carpenter uses different tools to build a house, developers use Azure services to build and maintain their digital applications efficiently.

---

## There are multiple ways to connect with Azure:
1. **Azure portal**: The web-based interface provided by Azure for managing and interacting with your resources.
2. **Azure PowerShell**: A command-line tool that allows you to manage and automate Azure resources using PowerShell scripts.
3. **Azure CLI**: A cross-platform command-line tool that provides a command-line interface for managing Azure resources.
4. **Azure ARM template**: Azure Resource Manager templates allow you to define and deploy your infrastructure as code.
5. **Azure SDKs**: Software development kits (SDKs) are available for various programming languages, providing libraries and tools to interact with Azure services programmatically.
